## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Vectors
Description
vector produces a vector of the given length and mode.

as.vector, a generic, attempts to coerce its argument into a vector of mode mode.

Ex:Enter the following data as a vector named "vec1"
1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6

```{r}
vec1<-c(1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6)
vec1
```
Accessing Vector Elements
Ex:print the 8th value of the vector "vec1"
```{r}
vec1[8]
```
#Sequence Generation
Description
Generate regular sequences. seq is a standard generic with a default method. seq.int is a primitive which can be much faster but has a few restrictions. seq_along and seq_len are very fast primitives for two common cases.
 seq(from,to,by,length.out,along.with)
Ex: Create a sequence "A" that contains all even numbers from 2 to 10
```{r}
A<-seq(2,10,2)
A

```
Ex:Create a sequence of length 100 starting with 2 and gap is equal to 2.
```{r}
B<-seq(from=2,by=2,length.out=100)
B
```
Ex : Create a sequence staring with 3 and ends with 15 but the length is equal to the length of the sequence "A"

```{r}
seq(3,15,along.with=A)
```
#Matrices
Description
matrix creates a matrix from the given set of values.

as.matrix attempts to turn its argument into a matrix.

is.matrix tests if its argument is a (strict) matrix.

Usage
matrix(data = NA, nrow = 1, ncol = 1, byrow = FALSE,
       dimnames = NULL)
Ex:arrange below numbers in to a 3*3 matrix named "mat1" sequentially by row.

```{r}
V<-1:9
mat1<-matrix(V,3,3,byrow=T)
mat1
```
Ex:arrange below numbers in to a 3*3 matrix named "mat2" sequentially by colum.
```{r}
mat2<-matrix(V,3,3,byrow=F)
mat2
```
Ex:Define the row names as "A","B","C" and column names as "D","E","F"
```{r}
mat2<-matrix(V,3,3,F,dimnames=list(c("A","B","C"),c("D","E","F")))
mat2
```
##Matrix computation
Ex:addition
```{r}
mat1+ mat2
```
Ex:substraction
```{r}
mat1-mat2
```
Ex: multiplication element by element
```{r}
mat1*mat2
```
Ex:multiplication matrix
```{r}
mat1%*%mat2
```
Ex:Divided
```{r}
mat1/mat2
```

**Creating a data frame:Method 1**

 Store all variables as separate vectors and then combine

>data.frame(Variable_1,Variable_2,..)

Ex:-Crate a data frame named"data1" using following data
Name: Kamal,Nimal.Sunil
Age:24,30,21

```{r}
Name<-c("Kamal","Nimal","Sunil")
Age<-c(24,30,21)
data1<-data.frame(Name,Age)
data1
```
**Create a Data Frame:Method 2**
  Read from files
+In R,we can read data from files stored outside the R environment
+We can read data from files such as Text,CSV,Excel,Web etc.
>read.csv("File path.csv",header=TRUE)
or
>read.csv(file.choose(),header=TRUE)

```{r}
data2<-read.csv("D:/New folder/R/pera/data2.csv",header=1)
data2
```
**R built-in data sets**
>data()

```{r}
data()
CO2
```
   Structure Of data Frame
Check the structure of each colum of a data set 
mention the classes of variables in a data frame

```{r}
str(data2)
```

 Exact Data From Data Frame
Ex:-Extract 1st colum of data1

```{r}
colum1<-data1[,1]
colum1
```
Ex:Extract the age of kamal
```{r}
data1[1,2]
```

  Naming Columns
Ex:Check the colum names of Data1
```{r}
names(data1)
```
Ex:Changing the first column names of data1 as First_Name
```{r}
names(data1)[1]<-"First_Name"
View(data1)
```
Ex:Change the First and third column names of data2 into "First name","Sex"
```{r}
names(data2)[c(1,3)]<-c("First_Name","Sex")
data2  
```
  Expand the data frame
1.Add anew column to a data frame
cbind()
Ex:Add hight colum to the data1 height:136,145,156

```{r}
Height<-c(136,145,156)
data1<- cbind(data1,Height)
data1
```

2.Add anew row to data frame
rbind()

Ex:Add following data as new row to the data2 and save it as data3
"Kamala",65,"F"

```{r}
vec<-c("Kamala",65,"F")
data3<-rbind(data2,vec)
data3
```
3.Merge Data Frame
>merge(data_frame1,data_frame2)

#primary key is the same for both data sets

```{r}
merge(data1,data2)
```

#primary key is the not same for both data sets

Ex:change the column heading of the data1 "First_Name" into "Name" merge data1 and data2

```{r}
names(data1)[1]<-"Name"
merge(data1,data2,by.x="Name",by.y="First_Name") 
```

   #Duplicate Data
   
The function unique() will return a data with the duplicate rows or columns remove

The function duplicate() returens a logical vector indicating which rows are duplicate

```{r}
duplicated(data1)
unique(data1)
```



#Random Number Genarations
The term random refers to any collection of data or information with no determined order
+The Values are Uniformly distributed over a defined interval or set
+It is impossible to predict future values based on past or present ones

R contains many functions that allows youy genarate random data.Those can be either from a vector of data that you specify(like heads or tails from a coins),or from an established probability distribution,like the normal or Uniform distribution.

**random Values from a vector**
sample(x,size,replace,prob)
Ex;Genarate 10 random numbers from the vector v that contains values from 1 to 1000

```{r}
V<-1:1000
sample(V,10)
```
Ex:Genarate 10 random values from the vector X={Head,Tail}
```{r}
X<-c("Head","Tail")
sample(X,10,T)
```

EX:-Genarate 10 random values from the vector X={Apple,Mango}.Probability of selecting a mango=0.7,and probability of selecting an apple equals to 0.3

```{r}
X<-c("Apple","Mango")
sample(X,10,T,c(0.3,0.7))
```

**Random Numbers from Distributions**
+Always start with r (for random)
+Base R package:rnom(),runif()
There are many other distribution availabale as part of the add-on packages.
 Ex:tweedie package contains tweedie distribution
 
Random Number from Uniform Distribution
>runif(n,min,max)

Ex:genarate 10 random numbers from a uniform distribution.Min=2,Max=5
```{r}
runif(10,2,5)
```
Random Numbers from Normal Distribution
>rnorm(n,mean,sd)

Ex:Genarate 10 numbers from a normal distribution.mean=2.1,sd=5
```{r}
rnorm(10,2.1,5)
```

**Control Random Samplilng with set.seed()**
Use in case where you want to exert some control over the random samples that 
R produces from sampling functions.

E:you may want to create a reproducible example of some control over the random samples that R produces from sampling functions.

Ex:you may want to create a reproducible example of some code that anyone else can repicate exactly.

>set.seed(n)

##without set the seed
Ex:Genarate 10 random numbers from the sequence 1:5
```{r}
sample(1:5,10,T)
```

##Set the seed to any number

Ex:set the seed to 123
```{r}
set.seed(123)
```
```{r}
sample(1:5,10,T)
```
```{r}
sample(1:5,10,T)
```

 If you need to remove the seed
 >set.seed(NULL)
 
```{r}
set.seed(NULL)
```
 
***Repeatedly simulated CAta with Replicates**
The replicate()  function makes repeated simulations.it is specifically made for the repeates evaluation of an expression.
>replicate(n,expr,simplify)

Ex:repeat thee functions "sample(1:5,10,T)"  times and get the output in to a list

```{r}
replicate(3,sample(1:5,10,T),F)
```
```{r}
replicate(3,sample(1:5,10,T),T)
```
